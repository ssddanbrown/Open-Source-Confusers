# Open Source Confusers

A list of people/groups that are bringing confusion to Open Source.

[Skip to the list](#the-list)

## History & Purpose

After getting involved in Open Source I've noticed people misrepresenting their licenses or using the term "Open Source" while using a license which does not meet the commonly understood [definition](https://opensource.org/osd). Of course people are free to use words however they want, but most cases I see this occur are those that would bring benefit to the author while propagating confusion of the Open Source term and licencing, and eroding the efforts made by many other to contribute and build the reputation of Open Source.

This list highlights such cases in an attempt to highlight confusion they're propagating.

Many will see this as pedantic gatekeeping, which it may be from a certain perspective, but I see this as protecting & advocating for something that's wonderful and an idea I can believe in.

## Scope

I've set some criteria for this list to focus on those actively causing potential confusion in the Open Source space. Some cases can be accidental, as Open Source and licensing can be complex topics, so I don't want to call out, or put pressure, on those that are simply in the process of learning or too small to cause issue.
Therefore, the criteria is as follows (and may change over time):

- Must be a person/group inferring incorrect information about their Open Source license, or using the term "Open Source" in a non [OSD](https://opensource.org/osd) manner.
- Must have a reasonable following, popularity or visibility (Have published news articles, over 1k GitHub stars etc...).
- Must have been (politely) advised of their potential confusion, and subsequently chosen to continue with their confusion or they have avoided any response after a reasonable amount of time.

## Disclaimer

Much of this list is of my ([Dan Brown](https://github.com/ssddanbrown/)) opinion. I am not a lawyer in any way, nor an expert of the law, and I may make mistakes. I am a maintainer and contributor of Open Source projects, I have a strong opinion of Open Source, and an argument could be made that I benefit from preventing the confusion I am looking to point out.

## Feedback & Contribution
